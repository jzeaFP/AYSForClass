# AYSForClass (AYS Funding)

## Live Website
https://aysfunding.com

## Overview
AYS Funding is the live website scaffold for our web business concept, AYS (Are You Sure?).  
This milestone focuses on going live: domain + hosting + SSL + basic site structure.

## Tech Stack
- WordPress (CMS + site builder)
- Domain Registrar: WordPress
- Domain: aysfunding.com
- SSL/HTTPS: Enabled via WordPress

## Repository Purpose
This repository documents the setup process (domain, hosting, plugins, and deployment notes).  
WordPress core files are not included because the site is managed through WordPress hosting.

## Documentation
See `/documentation/` for:
- domain-setup.md
- hosting-setup.md
- plugin-list.md

## Known Issues
- Duplicate nested `documentation/` folder may exist due to early repo setup. It does not affect the live site or documentation.
